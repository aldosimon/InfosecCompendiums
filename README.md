The infosec compendiums project aims to inventories topics of information security (e.g. tools, scripts, cheat sheets, knowledge bases, among other things)

The project started because from time to time I need access to a specific infosec project but can't remember its name to search.

So, the main goal of the project is to provide a one pager with an easy way to filter or search. The project accomplished this by providing “subject”, "object" and “predicate” columns to filter.

For instance if you are trying to find something that list/ explain various cloudtrail api calls, you’ll use filter "tool", "explain", "cloudTrail" in the "subject”, “predicate”, and “object” column respectively.

## todo

create a schema so consistent wording especially throughout the SPO.
